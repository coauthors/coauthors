# Easier to share ideas 🌴

<div class="py-4 pt-8 text-xl">
    "We leave tons of commits every day. among these commits, <b>there are many commits that were created based on ideas given to me by colleagues.</b> In fact, good ideas are not
    code, but are written into code through discussion with many people and then committed."

### Idea givers can be motivated by `Co-Authoring`

There is a way to add idea giver as Co-Author of a commit in GitHub. Co-Authoring can motivate idea givers. At least it makes them feel good.

## 🥲 Problem: Difficulties with `Co-Authoring`

But In our opinion, it's quite hard to make idea givers as Co-Author in commit message

<Steps>

### Too complicated grammar 📚

```shell /Co-authored-by: Jonghyeon Ko <61593290+manudeli@users.noreply.github.com>/ /Co-authored-by: Whale <71202076+2-NOW@users.noreply.github.com>/
git commit -m "feat: add some feature

Co-authored-by: Jonghyeon Ko <61593290+manudeli@users.noreply.github.com>
Co-authored-by: Whale <71202076+2-NOW@users.noreply.github.com>"
```

You must know exactly the grammar provided by GitHub. Spacing, text order, capitalization, etc. must be written accurately.

### High possibility to fail finding public email 📧

The email must be registered in the other person's GitHub account. in addition, there is a high possibility that the email will not appear in the other person's GitHub profile.

### Number of GitHub id should be required 🤖

```text /61593290/ /manudeli/
61593290+manudeli@users.noreply.github.com
```

If you want the email to follow the format below, you need to know username and the numeric ID of Co-Author's GitHub account.

   </Steps>
