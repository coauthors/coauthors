# Coauthors GitHub App

Many ideas are shared not only through commits but also through comments. However, if you do not co-author the idea contributors who only left comments, they will just be left as comments and will not be included in the contributors section of your GitHub repository.

![Example](/img/github-app-example.png)

The Coauthors GitHub App automatically provides a string that matches the co-authoring syntax so that contributors can easily add them as co-authors on their own commits, even if they only left comments. This works in GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.

This allows people who only provided ideas through comments, not commits, to become contributors, which can motivate them to contribute ideas and lead to more communication within your repository.
